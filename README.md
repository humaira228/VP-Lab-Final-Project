RouteAI – EcoTrack 🌿
Health-Conscious Route Planning with AI Integration

A full-stack web application that provides personalized, health-focused route recommendations. It combines real-time air quality data, user health profiles, and machine learning to calculate a Health Safety Score for navigation alternatives, helping users avoid pollution and disease hotspots.

For Therap JavaFest:

✨ Features
Intelligent Routing: Get multiple route alternatives scored on health factors, not just distance.
Real-Time Environmental Data: Integrates live Air Quality Index (AQI) from the WAQI API.
Personalized Health Profiles: Users specify health conditions (e.g., asthma, allergies) for tailored advice.
Machine Learning Health Scoring: A Python Flask microservice provides an enhanced AI-powered health score prediction.
Interactive Map Visualization: Built with React and Leaflet.js to display routes and environmental heatmaps.
Secure JWT Authentication: Full user registration and login system.
Robust Fallback System: The Java backend uses a rule-based scoring algorithm if the ML service is unavailable.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
JDK 17
Node.js (v18 or higher) + npm
Python 3.10+ + pip
PostgreSQL (v12+) with PostGIS extension
Git
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ecotrack
2. Database Setup
Create a PostgreSQL database named ecotrack.
Enable the PostGIS extension:
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
3. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)
cd backend

# Configure your application.properties file:
# - Set spring.datasource.url, username, and password
# - Add your API keys: aqicn.token and ors.api.key

# Run the application with Gradle
./gradlew bootRun
The backend server will start on http://localhost:9090.

4. Frontend Setup (React)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

5. ML Service Setup (Python Flask)
cd ml-service

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask application
python app.py
The ML service will start on http://localhost:5000.

🔐 Configuration
API Keys (Required)
You must obtain and configure the following API keys in backend/src/main/resources/application.properties:

# WAQI API for Air Quality Data
aqicn.token=your_waqi_api_key_here

# OpenRouteService API for Routing
ors.api.key=your_ors_api_key_here

# PostgreSQL Database
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ecotrack
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
How to get API keys:

WAQI: Sign up at waqi.info
OpenRouteService: Sign up at openrouteservice.org
ML Service Connection
The Spring Boot backend is pre-configured to call the ML service. Ensure the Flask app is running on http://localhost:5000. The fallback mechanism will handle any connection issues gracefully.

🧠 Machine Learning Model
The EnhancedHealthPredictor class in /ml-service is responsible for the intelligent health scoring.

Features Used for Prediction:
Real-time AQI value
Route distance and duration
Historical pollution data for the area
User health profile (sensitivity, conditions)
Time of day and weather data (optional)
Training:
The model is a Stacking Regressor combining:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) The model is trained on historical urban environmental data and saved as a .pkl file for the Flask app to load.
🚀 Deployment
Backend (Spring Boot)
cd backend
# Create a production JAR
./gradlew build -x test

# Run the JAR
java -jar build/libs/ecotrack-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Frontend (React)
cd frontend
# Create a production build
npm run build

# Deploy the 'build' folder to a static host (Vercel, Netlify, S3)
ML Service (Python)
For production, deploy the Flask app using a WSGI server like Gunicorn:

pip install gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Use a process manager like PM2 to keep it running:

pm2 start --name "ml-service" "gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app"
📊 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/auth/register	User registration
POST	/api/auth/login	User login (returns JWT)
GET	/api/route/recommend	Get health-scored routes
GET	/api/aqi	Get AQI for a location
POST	/api/profile	Save user health profile
POST	http://ml-service:5000/predict	(ML Service) Get AI health score
🧪 Testing the System
Start all services (PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, React, Flask).
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
Register a new user account.
Set up your health profile in the Profile section.
Go to the Map page to generate recommended routes between two points.
